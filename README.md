# AatixxIO

Hey! Welcome to my GtiHub page. 
 
My name is Aatixx and I am freelance developer that works accross a large number of development areas including Java, web & games.  
To find out a little more about me, you can check out my website [bly clicking here](https://aatixx.io/), or if you want to get in touch with me [click here to join my discord](https://discord.gg/gjCTzgB).  
Over the coming weeks, I will be filling this GitHub with a couple of free open source Minecraft related projects to help developers get things done quickly. If you have any projects you would like to see me work on and release, feel free to contact me, I'm always looking for new crazy ideas to bring to life.
